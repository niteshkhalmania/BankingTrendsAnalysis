# Analyzing Banking Trends: Customer Transactions and Regional Impact

## Project Overview

In the dynamic world of banking and finance, understanding customer behavior and the regional impact of transactions is essential for informed decision-making and strategic planning. The project, titled "Analyzing Banking Trends: Customer Transactions and Regional Impact," is designed to explore and analyze transaction data to extract valuable insights into customer behavior patterns and their potential implications on different world regions.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to delve into customer transactions and identify trends that may impact regional economies and financial systems. By applying data cleaning techniques in Python and utilizing SQL queries on interconnected tables, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of how customer transactions vary across different regions and the potential implications for the banking sector.

## Data Sources

To achieve our objectives, we leverage three key tables that provide essential information for analysis:

1. **world_regions table:** This table contains data on various world regions, including their corresponding codes and names. It serves as a reference to categorize customers based on their regional affiliation.

2. **user_nodes table:** The user_nodes table holds crucial details about consumers' banking nodes, including their unique consumer IDs, associated region IDs, node IDs, start dates, and end dates. This data enables us to identify the specific banking nodes to which customers are connected and their duration of association.

3. **user_transaction table:** This table is a comprehensive repository of customer transactions, containing data such as consumer IDs, transaction dates, types of transactions, and transaction amounts. Analyzing this data allows us to uncover patterns in customer spending and financial behaviors.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

Module 1: **Data Pre-processing using Python:** In this phase, we perform data cleaning tasks using Python. This includes handling missing values, data type conversions, and any necessary data transformations.

Task 1: Check The Null Values

Task 2: Find The Duplicate Values

Task 3: Remove The Duplicate Values

Task 4: Data Cleaning:

Task 5: Check The Null Values

Task 6: Find The Duplicate Values

Task 7: Remove The Duplicate Values

Task 8: Data Cleaning:

Module 2: **Analyzing data using MySQL:** We utilize SQL queries to perform an in-depth analysis of the cleaned data. This involves extracting insights related to customer behavior, transaction trends, and regional impacts. SQL queries enable us to aggregate and manipulate the data effectively.
